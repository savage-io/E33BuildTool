        "Maelle is a central playable character in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, introduced early in the "
        "narrative as a young woman grappling with her place in a world overshadowed by the Paintress. "
        "Orphaned at a young age and fostered by Gustave's family, she joins Expedition 33 viewing it "
        "as an opportunity for self-discovery beyond the confines of Lumi√®re. In combat, Maelle "

        "Maelle's combat identity revolves around her three distinct stances: Defensive, Offensive, and "
        "Virtuose. Unlike other characters, her effectiveness is directly tied to which stance she currently "
        "occupies, influencing her damage output, defensive capabilities, and even AP generation. She "
        "can also be in a neutral 'Stanceless' state, which offers no inherent benefits. "
        "Mastering Maelle requires actively managing these stances. Entering any of the three main "
        "stances grants Maelle 1 Action Point (AP), rewarding players for fluidly transitioning between "
        "them. Skills are the primary method for changing stances... Basic attacks also interact with stances..."
